# Lab Assignments

All lab assignments are done online with assistance from teaching assistants and the instructor during session hours. The best part of the course is developing with databases in the assignments. Please follow the submission guidelines.

**All assignments must be done in groups of two people.** No collaboration outside a group is allowed. The group must be setup on Canvas and only one submission per group is accepted.

**Many assignments use Docker to run databases on your computer. Follow the [setup instructions](setup) to get started.**

**Bonus for early submission: 10% bonus for certain labs if show answer to instructor/TA before Monday 4 p.m. the week assignment is due. 5% bonus if show answer to instructor/TA before Wednesday 4 p.m.**
